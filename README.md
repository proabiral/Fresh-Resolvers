# Fresh-Resolvers
List of Hourly Updated Valid DNS resolvers

[DNS Validator](https://github.com/vortexau/dnsvalidator) is used to validate DNS resolvers from [public-dns.info](https://public-dns.info/nameservers.txt), which is pushed to this repository on Hourly Basis.

This list can be used with other tools that make use of resolves like [shuffledns](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns), [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns), [zdns](https://github.com/zmap/zdns) etc

### Thanks :
